### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Willie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamrumbos/) and I am a second-year civil engineering student at North Carolina State University Go Pack! I'm currently learning Python with an emphasis on scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

I would for sure be interested in small projects related to the fields above and would love to be able to learn from others.
