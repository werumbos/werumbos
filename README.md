### Hey, my name is [Will!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamrumbos/) ðŸ‘‹

I am a second-year civil engineering student at North Carolina State University and I'm currently teaching myself Python with an emphasis on scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

I would for sure be interested in small projects related to the fields above and would love to be able to learn and collaborate with others.
