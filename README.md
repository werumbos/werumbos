### Hey, my name is [Willie!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamrumbos/) 👋

I am a second-year civil engineering student at North Carolina State University Go Pack! I'm currently teaching myself Python with an emphasis on scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

I would for sure be interested in small projects related to the fields above and would love to be able to learn and collaborate with others.
